=============================
SkipGram feature generator
=============================

Introduction
============
Generates text based feature from string using Spark's Word2Vec.

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
--------------
CDAP version 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT or higher.

Building Plugins
----------------
You get started with Run transform plugin by building directly from the latest source code::

   git clone https://github.com/hydrator/skipgram-analytics.git
   cd skipgram-analytics
   mvn clean package

After the build completes, you will have a JAR for each plugin under each
``<plugin-name>/target/`` directory.

Deploying Plugins
-----------------
You can deploy a plugin using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact <target/plugin-jar> config-file <resources/plugin-config>

  > load artifact target/skipgram-analytics-plugin-<version>.jar \
         config-file target/skipgram-analytics-plugin-<version>.json

You can build without running tests: ``mvn clean install -DskipTests``

Limitations
-----------
- UI doesn't support schema's with hyphens (-), so the plugin currently transforms all the schemas with - into underscores (_). This change will be reverted after this is fixed: https://issues.cask.co/browse/HYDRATOR-1125

Mailing Lists
-------------
CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:

- `cdap-user@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user>`__

The *cdap-user* mailing list is primarily for users using the product to develop
applications or building plugins for appplications. You can expect questions from
users, release announcements, and any other discussions that we think will be helpful
to the users.

IRC Channel
-----------
CDAP IRC Channel: #cdap on irc.freenode.net
